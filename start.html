  Omelette (fr. Omelette) — scrambled eggs, to which milk[1] or other liquid[2] is added, for example, water, cream, broth, decoction, juice and, in a number of recipes, a small amount of any flour, for example, wheat, oatmeal, buckwheat, barley, rye, potato, pea. These components are beaten together with eggs and liquid prior to heat treatment. Cooking can include frying in a pan, baking in the oven, or cooking in a water bath. Additional variety is achieved by adding finely chopped sausage, fried meat, cheese, salted or boiled mushrooms, onions, garlic, parsley leaves, celery, chervil, basil, savory, thyme, etc. during heat treatment.[3] As a rule, omelettes are served for breakfast.

    As sweet dishes, omelettes are used, cooked with jam, honey, etc.[2] V. V. Pokhlebkin considers it wrong to call such dishes omelettes, they have the name malt [3].</p>
    
    <p> (meat, vegetables, etc.) can be wrapped in an omelette [4]. A dish of egg-milk mixture with a consistency like sour cream, cooked in a saucepan or in a water bath, is called egg porridge [5].
